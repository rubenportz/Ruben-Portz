There’s a common misunderstanding among digital startups that your first marketing hire should be a Growth Hacker. A user acquisition ninja who ruthlessly executes marketing strategies and aggressively split tests every colour and call-to-action.


This might make sense as you’ve just launched your product and you now want to hit that 10% week-on-week growth rate. 

Chances are, however, that this will be a massive step in the wrong direction. 

<h2>Everyone is on the growth team</h2>
For almost all startups the Northstar metric is either active users or (periodic recurring) revenue. So whether you're working on design, marketing, research or engineering - that’s your high-level goal. It’s thus strange to have a separate function for growth, as everybody in a startup is technically on the growth team. 

My feeling is that companies that hire growth hackers are looking for shortcuts and quick wins. They start throwing features and small marketing campaigns into the public to see what sticks instead of having a precision approach. It’s a recipe for premature scaling and eventual failure.

<h2>Wearing too many hats for too long</h2>
Another reason to be careful with growth hackers is that they tend to jump from social and content to CPC, email and offline. This might seem normal as every other person in the team does multiple jobs in the beginning. Backend engineers are taking on data analysis, while the frontend team is also covering UX and design requirements. 

The problem with this is that the team is unlikely to be great at every skill and might neglect some important tasks that seem trivial at first. I see research being one of those items. 

User research seems at first far away from engineering. It is generally appointed to the marketers. However, they see their function as acquiring users and assume the product already has the product-market fit. Consequently, big product decisions end up being made based on intuition and not proper user research.

At the same time, a lot of marketing channels are being tried instead of focussing on one or two channels and doing those very well.

This puts the startup in a vulnerable position. 


So how should you structure your team to set yourself up for growth?

<h2>Don’t get hackers, stick to designers, community builders and engineers</h2>
This brings me back to the issue of wearing too many hats for too long. As a rule of thumb I’d say that if any function takes up more than 50% of someone’s time, then it’s worth becoming a full-time position. 

However, I see people, including myself, having a tendency to undervalue the true skill and expertise required for roles such as UI design, UX design, user research, dev-ops and specific marketing verticals like SEO or CPC. You think you can apply the 80:20 rule doing a bit of everything but unknowingly miss the little nuances of the trade.


Nevertheless, if you do decide to expand then don’t hire a growth hacker. Spend your budget on specialists. Don’t create siloed marketing, frontend and backend teams. Be a bit more considerate and structure the team in a way that forces collaboration towards a common goal. 

I think the ideal structure for growing an online startup consists of six core functionalities that each share at least one goal with another team.

<h2>Community builders</h2>
The one thing competitors cannot copy is your relationship with your users. There’s no better time to start building this community than from the absolute start. The more people trust you, the better you can perform market research and figure out what the money-making product will be and how it should evolve. 

The other main benefit of having a community is that you’ve got to provide valuable content and personalised communication. This takes a whole other approach to marketing. 

Instead of doing SEO, CPC, content, email and partnerships to get people into your product, you’re now aiming to become part of your customers existing communities and build your own along the way. 

You might still be testing what channels work best, but you actually have to engage with the users and you’ll quickly see what platform provides the best response for your audience. This work will mainly rest on organic social posting in forums and groups, direct messaging, and content marketing. It will be less advertising related.

It’s a healthy long-term branding approach instead of a short-term transactional approach. 

<h2>User Experience Team</h2>

This team consists of four functions. All of them should heavily collaborate and iterate to take away as many user behaviour uncertainties as possible before starting to hard-code.

<ul>
<li><b>Interaction Designer:</b> creates the design strategy, identifies key interactions of the product, comes up with improvements and creates low-fidelity mockups for the user researcher to test and validate.</li>
<li><b>User Researcher:</b> documents the behaviors, needs, and motivations of users through research methods such as session recordings, heatmaps, interviews, surveys, participatory designs, usability sessions, and sentiment analysis across social. Most importantly, they will know your user the best.</li>
<li><b>Visual Designer:</b> creates high-fidelity designs that form the look and feel for every state of the app. They maintain the company’s style guide and translate the UX requirements from the interaction designer into a branded user interface.</li>
<li><b>Frontend Engineer:</b> implements the visual elements from the high-fidelity design taking into consideration the accessibility, consistency, performance, security and quality of code. You really want the frontend engineers to think from a user’s perspective and should thus be part of the UX team, not the engineering team.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Backend Engineers</h2>
Not much to say here to be honest. The backend team codes most of the logic and specialize in data structures and code efficiency. Early-stage startups generally don’t hire for the middle stack, which might be something to consider. There’s quite some specialisation one can do on the glue that connects frontend with the backend - think of input handling, https protocols, rest APIs, etc. That would free up mental space for the backend engineers to focus on the core of the app, minimising the risk of building in unnecessary complexity and increasing the output velocity.

<h2>DevOps Engineers</h2>
You don’t want this to be a side task as a single mistake can bring down your entire company. They ensure the app is running at all times, are responsible for automated testing, establish the entire infrastructure, run the deployment strategy, and keep an eye on the tech stack’s costs. These people are worth their money as they can save you a tonne of costs.

<h2>Data Scientists</h2>
Once you start scaling you will have a lot of data to run regression analyses and matrix completions. This shouldn’t be done by a backend engineer. Let them focus on the app logic. Instead, your data scientist should work closely with the user experience team to generate hypotheses and test them. They’ll be in a continuous loop of ideating, testing, and evaluating results. However, it might take awhile before you get to that point and can afford a dedicated role.

<h2>The whole is greater than the sum of its parts</h2>
To sum it all up - engineering, marketing, research and data are all cohesive parts to the successful growth of a product or business. Together they can achieve a synergy and velocity that has the potential to make a much bigger impact than any standalone team could ever achieve.

So before you start hiring Growth Hackers, realize that growth is not a position. It’s a mindset and a way of working. If you implement the right processes and organizational structure, then you have everything in-house to become one growth hacking machine.
