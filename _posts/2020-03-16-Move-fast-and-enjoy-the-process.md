The hidden fallacy of working at a startup is that you need to move fast without worrying you’re running in the wrong direction.

This is difficult!

When launching a product and 80% or even 90% of the channels, features, tactics and messaging you’re trying doesn’t move the needle, then I can bet you a little voice starts popping up in your head telling you that you’ve got no clue what’s going on.

You start thinking whether the product is wrong and doesn’t meet the user’s needs. Whether the timing might be off, that the seasonality is against you, or that the competition simply is too strong.

Or even worse, nobody seems to care.

But the interesting part is that if you keep going at it during those moments and follow a process of testing, researching and trying out a range of new things - that little successes start appearing.

This is what I’ve seen again and again.

Out of nowhere, you’ll experience some kind of response. A little bit of engagement. The worst looking ad performance the best. The strangest social post gets the most traffic. The most unlikely user profile gets back extremely positively.

Enough to make you zoom in on that tactic, person or channel and understand why it is happening and whether it is a good opportunity to do more.

If you work at a startup you have probably felt this way.

Some call it luck, serendipity, or a fluke.

But it’s more than that.

You’ve got to believe in your process.

The process of executing but also the journey that you’re on. 

Enjoy the voyage.

Not the serendipitous moments.

Once you believe in the process, the moments will follow.
