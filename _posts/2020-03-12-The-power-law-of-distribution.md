It can be overwhelming to generate traffic, but it doesn't have to be. We're actually in quite a lucky position being able to select from 100+ acquisition channels. And from those, the majority is even free to use.

This wasn't always the case. Imagine having to start a business back in the day and the only way to get awareness is by purchasing radio, magazine and billboard ads, having to pay 6 months in advance, and not getting any attribution in return.

The internet has put us in a position to reach anyone at any time, but yet many startups struggle to create sustainable traffic sources. Either we spray ourselves too thinly or are hunting the latest silver-bullet tactic only to see short-term spikes of traffic as a result.

The solution to creating a sustainable traffic source is by structurally testing what channel might work and then implementing a repeatable and scalable process.

<h2>The repeatable and scalable acquisition process</h2>
Here's how you can do this in practice both for new products or in my case, expanding an existing product into new markets.

<b>Step 1:</b> From the top of your mind, list the top 10 sources from which you think you can reach your users. This can be both online as offline.

Once done, go straight into those forums, platforms or locations and collect from at least 50 potential users (five if B2B) an answer to the following two questions:
<ol>
<li>Which products do you use to complete << the job to be done >>, and how did you find out about them?</li>
<li>What online discussion forums, platforms or websites do you use to engage with fellow << demographic or job title >>, and how frequently do you go there?</li>
</ol>

<b>Step 2:</b> From the answers, you should be able to narrow down where your users hang out and how they inform themselves to approximately six channels.

<b>Step 3:</b> From those six channels, we now want to know the finer details around cost, targeting, control, input time, output time and scalability.

You can either determine this based on your past experience and expertise. But I highly recommend actually spending 2–3 days trying out all six options simultaneously. This has worked best for the teams I've worked with.

This might mean that you'll be spending money on Google and Instagram ads, writing blog articles, posting on Linkedin and sending out cold emails all at the same time. In order to learn fast, you should tick the box on all six channels as quickly as possible.

That way you get a true sense of the potential and difficulty of each channel. Obviously, you'd need to dedicate more time to get statistically significant results, but this is mainly an exercise to separate channels that have potential from the ones that do not.

<b>Step 4:</b> From the distribution channel mix, we should now be able to pinpoint one or two channels that were mentioned by our users and that we found had a good shot at delivering results.

Most $100M+ companies have actually grown by using only a limited number of channels, which is commonly referred to as the 80:20 rule.

<img alt="Diagram showcasing that 20% of the marketing effort produces 80% of the results by Ruben Portz" src="/images/Paretto-effect.png" width="100%">

Approximately 20% of the effort produces 80% of the results. Whereas the last 20% of the results consume 80% of the effort.

When talking about results I would care the most about the cost of acquisition and total lifetime value of the users that come via a particular channel. This will have a direct impact on your sustainability and automatically exclude any channels with a high CAC. 

You might not find the exact CAC right away if you've got long sales cycles, but a healthy dose of common sense will take you a long way when planning your acquisition strategy.

Because startups face limited time and resources we want to be sure that we're focusing on the 20% of channels that deliver 80% of the results. Within the growth marketing world, this is also referred to as the power law of distribution.

<b>Step 5:</b> It's still important to be active on the other channels as any marketing channel will saturate over time. This doesn't mean that it will shut down overnight, but rather that it becomes extremely inefficient to generate the same results as before.

Therefore, it's advised to place a few eggs in channels that aren't working yet but could transform into your main channel down the line. With a few eggs, I mean less than 20% of your marketing resources.

I really like the analogy of a portfolio manager deciding on its asset allocation using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). This model describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets. It suggests that increased diversification across a set of uncorrelated assets results in better risk-adjusted returns for the full portfolio.

Translating this back to distribution channels means that even if a channel is very much unproven, you're better off owning some small amount of it as long as it presents little correlation with your main channel.

The average return of your marketing efforts will be lower than when spending 100% of your investment on one channel, but the risk-adjusted return will actually be higher when spending a little bit on other unproven channels.

The tasting of unproven channels enables you to identify when the market is shifting and allows you to move faster on the new channel because you've been trying it out already for a while.
