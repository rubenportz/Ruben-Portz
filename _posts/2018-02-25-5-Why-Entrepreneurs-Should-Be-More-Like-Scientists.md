Why Entrepreneurs should be more like Scientists
The lean start-up approach is built upon a process of rapid experimentation and testing of critical assumptions. It is a rigorous approach in which you should be focussed on matching problem, customer, and solution in a scientific way.
Although you, as an entrepreneur, might not want to be compared with a scientist. It’s the scientific way of thinking and working that will lead to success in the world of start-ups. As an entrepreneur you will have to make impactful decision under high uncertainty, and it should be your goal to take away as much of this uncertainty as fast and cheap as possible.
This is something multiple venture capitalists (VCs) told me as well. Learning is something that they see as a key focus point for early-stage start-ups. In the early days it is important to focus on testing, learning, and being open. You should spend a lot of time with customers to understand where they’re coming from, and learn from what they tell and show you.
As an entrepreneur, I think, it´s therefore important to act as a scientist. Scientists are persons who are engaging in a systematic activity to acquire knowledge that describes and predicts the natural world. So, what activities do the most successful entrepreneurs repeatedly use in the creation of their businesses? And can you perform those same activities to take away uncertainty letting you make better decisions.
3 Practical Ways To Be More Like a Scientist
The scientific element of entrepreneurship will determine the logical foundation of your startup. It should be your priority to figure out who your customers are, what they want, and how you can deliver to them, to even have a chance at success.
The scientific method that can be applied by entrepreneurs starts by asking a question, researching the subject, creating hypotheses, experimenting to test hypotheses, and reviewing the data to form a conclusion. Below I will describe three easy to implement experiment that are in line with this scientific methodolgy:
The validation interview
Before getting your hands dirty on any coding or landing page creation, you could perform 20+ validation interviews. All you need to do to perform a validation interview is to get in touch with a person from your prospective target audience to pitch them your idea and hear their feedback. 
After hearing their feedback you ask whether they know anyone who would need this solution. If yes, then you should ask whether they could call this person  right now, and pitch your idea to them. After they pitched the idea, you should ask if you could speak with that person to setup a meeting, and do exactly the same.
By doing so, you do not only get valuable feedback, you also hear whether they understand your product and whether they can explain it to somebody else. Moreover, it directly shows you the referral rate of the product, and gets your introduced to new potential customers.

The validation question
In case you already have a product and users, then you can send out a one-question validation survey to identify how much customers love your product. This one question was introduced by Sean Ellis – founder of growthhackers.com – in his book Hacking Growth. The question goes like:
	How disappointed would you be if this product no longer existed tomorrow?
A)	Very disappointed
B)	Somewhat disappointed
C)	Not disappointed (it really isn’t that useful)
D)	N/A – I no longer use it
If 40% or more of the respondents indicate that they would be very disappointed, then you’ve found product-market fit and you’re ready to focus on growth. If you score less than 40%, you’ll need to ask a few follow-up questions to confirm validation or not. These question can be found in his book – Hacking Growth by Sean Ellis – available on Amazon.

The Five Whys
As Eric Ries states: “The key to startup growth is to maintain a disciplined approach to testing and evaluating new products, features, and ideas” (HBR, April 2010). One of the techniques that help early one with getting in to right mindset is called the Five Whys. It’s a technique that originates from the Toyota Production System, but has a vast application to startups. 
Here’s for an example of the Five Whys from Eric Ries:
1.	A new release broke a key feature for customers. Why? Because a particular server failed.
2.	Why did the server fail? Because an obscure subsystem was used in the wrong way.
3.	Why was it used in the wrong way? The engineer who used it didn’t know how to use it properly.
4.	Why didn’t he know? Because he was never trained.
5.	Why wasn’t he trained? Because his manager doesn’t believe in training new engineers, because they are “too busy.”
These kind of root-cause analysis can quickly identify the core problems that you need to solve within your own organization, or for a customer. By talking to the customer and using this technique to drill down into the root-cause, can provide you with the right problem to solve in a matter of minutes.

50 Validation Experiments
The above three techniques can quickly be applied for any business idea to identify what problem is worth solving. Once you found the problem and created a solution it is time to grow, which also needs a scientific approach to entrepreneurship by using data to quickly iterate through growth experiments.
Please leave a comment below if you like the above mentioned techniques and will use them in your validation journey. Also leave your email address in case you want access to a list of 50 growth experiments that can be run in your startup.
