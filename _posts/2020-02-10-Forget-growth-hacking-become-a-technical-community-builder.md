It's rare that you interview someone and although it's not a great fit right now, he or she is genuinely interested in knowing how to develop themselves to be ready one day.

In that situation, I think it's only fair to take time and give a sense of direction. I understand that big corporates avoid this at all cost for legal reasons, but that's probably a guarantee someone will not get back to them once they're actually ready for it.

<h2>Technical Marketing + Community Building</h2>
I've put below a menu of resources for developing yourself further as a technical marketer. I've recommended these to my team, people I didn't hire, or anyone who's willing to listing to me.

This recommendation is focussed on smaller growth teams (<10 people), and especially for those who've just graduated and need to be multi-facetted in their growth role no matter the industry.

My recommendation starts by developing deep expertise in the next five topics and from there on building a broader knowledge base in a variety of other areas among community building.

<h2>Never stop learning</h2>
In my opinion, the associated sources are a great start to build a solid foundation in these 5 areas. I really recommend going through as many tutorials and blog posts as possible as well as find additional practice material and real-life examples if you're interested in product marketing.

The best people I know, have made it a routine to keep developing themselves on a daily basis and to never stop learning via books, blogs, online courses or youtube videos.

<h2>Relevant product marketing resources</h2>
Once you've got the above fundamentals checked, it's time to become a T-shaped marketer. For the next ten years, I think that creative and communication skills will become far more important than technical skills. This is because a lot of technical complexity will become code-less.

It's up to you to find a healthy mix between psychological, technical, business and creative skills and understanding.

Here's a great list of additional resources for the ones leaning a bit more towards growth hacking. But before you read it I want to emphasise that community building is probably the most important skill to learn. The only problem is that it takes time and can only be learned by doing.
