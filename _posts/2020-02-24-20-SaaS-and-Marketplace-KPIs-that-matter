Best practices in marketing and product result a lot around high-tempo testing and funnel optimization. A key framework often used is the so-called pirate metrics aka AAARRR: awareness, acquisition, activation, revenue, retention, referral. 

This framework implies that a marketing funnel consists of six stages and that it’s important to know at what stage you’re seeing the largest user drop-off as that’s where your efforts will be most efficient.

There are, however, two flaws within this thinking. 

Firstly, it doesn’t consider a compounding relationship between stages. For example, more revenue directly influences the amount of paid traffic you can afford. Similarly, increased referral numbers causes more organic or direct traffic. In both cases you’ll gain more users without specifically optimizing for the acquisition stage.

Secondly, which will be the emphasis of this essay, is that the most common startup models - SaaS, marketplace, and ecommerce platform - consist of many micro-stages next to the six aggregated steps. You cannot permit yourself to overlook the details of those smaller steps.

<h2>SaaS</h2>

I tried to display an average funnel that consists of around 14 steps. However, iit goes without saying that there are many variations in designing the order of steps.

The diagram becomes most useful when you’re tracking the delta between two steps over time. This will help to steer your team towards the biggest gains as well as to alert when big spikes or drops happen.

A key part of the SaaS model is the loop from active or paying users to inviting other users, as well as the reactivation loop. Optimizing for these can really multiply your growth. 

<h2>Two-Sided Marketplace</h2>

Marketplace startups are known for having the chicken-and-egg problem. You’re unable to generate demand without having sufficient supply. And nobody wants to be your supplier when you don’t have any demand.

It becomes even more apparent when you draw out the entire relationship between demand and supply. As you will see, the demand funnel looks very much like the SaaS model. The main difference though is that there’s still the full supply side with its own dynamics. This makes you realize that marketplaces are really two businesses packed inside of one.

The cornerstone of the model are the review and results engine. This has both a feedback loop towards the supply and demand side causing certain products or services to rank higher and others to not make any gains off the platform.

<h2>Ecommerce platform</h2>

The ecommerce model looks again very similar to the SaaS model, but slightly more simplistic. The product generally has a faster route to revenue. Moreover, retention is less dependent on the core value of the tech, but more on the (email) marketing around the platform and the quality of products offered for sale.

Nevertheless, there’s added complexity surrounding the delivery and return logistics that cannot be overlooked when designing the business.
