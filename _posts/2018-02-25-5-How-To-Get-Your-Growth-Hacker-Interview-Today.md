How to get a job interview today

More and more people are going to online platform like Angellist to find their dream job in the tech world. They are leaving the corporate lifestyle to join the like of the Silicon Valley unicorns.
The problem with listing like Angel.co is that certain positions are in extreme high demand. Titles like business developer, marketer or growth hacker can theoretically be fulfilled by anyone with a business degree. You, therefore, have to easily compete with 30+ candidates, while the companies are mainly early-stage without any dedicated HR staff to spit through the applicants.










So how can you stand out and get an interview the same day?
The secret to getting recognizes is not by writing the best cover letter, applying multiple times in a row, or making sure you’re the first.
What worked several times for me, is by not applying at all. So, let me tell you how that works.
When opening the job posting on Angellist and clicking the apply button, you’ll be asked to write a nice introduction message or small cover letter. Don’t do this.
Instead, look a bit more careful, and click on the profile of the contact person. This is usually the CEO or one of the other key figures within the company.
 




















Once you arrive at the Angel profile of the contact person, you will often see that they connected there LinkedIn profile. Click on the link, and send him or her a connect invitation on LinkedIn with a note saying: Hi YYY, I’ve heard that you’re searching for a XXXX. I’m currently looking for opportunities in that direction. I researched your website, which looks really interesting and I was wondering whether you found someone already?


 
This worked multiple times for me to get a call scheduled the same day, or within a week. These entrepreneurs are very open to opportunities. It’s your job to make sure that they see you. Your LinkedIn headline should match the job description, and show some company interest in your messaging. You’re almost guaranteed to get a response, and if the position is still available, you might get a phone interview just hours later.
 
It’s a great way to stand out from the dozes of application that they will get via Angellist and other recruiting platforms. You should realize how hard it is to find the best candidate once you have to scroll through dozens of applicants.
 













It is really a pain in the ass, especially once the same position is also available on F6S, Upwork, and workinginstartups.com To make you really stand out, the best way is to simply get in touch with the team directly. And if you don’t know them personally, or anyone close to the team, then LinkedIn is your number 1 alternative.
Let me know if you like this tactic, and whether you’ll try it out when searching for your start-up gig.
