You will fail if your start-up is doing this
74% of start-ups fail because of premature scaling. This happens when you go to quickly from one stage of the start-up lifecycle to the next one – Discovery, Validation, Efficiency, Scale, Sustain & Conservation.
You should move your start-up to the next stage once you reached certain milestones that can be measured by customer response to a product. These metrics might include things like activation rate, user growth, total number of users, retention rate and revenue. 
Based on the stage of your start-up you should behave in a certain way that is consistent with your progress. On a higher level there are only 5 dimensions that you can steer – Customer, Product, Team, Financials, and Business Model – and your job is to focus on the right dimensions at the right time.
Actual Stage	Focus areas
	Avg. time to reach next stage

Discovery	Problem & Customer	6 months
Validation	Customer & Product	4 months
Efficiency	Product & Business Model	7 months
Scale	Team & Financials	8 months

Examples of when you will fail
If you focus too much on a dimension that is not aligned with the actual stage of your start-up, then you’re steering yourself into the wrong direction. Below are some examples per dimension of how you can miss prioritize focus areas.
Customer failure - Pets.com
Your priority is customer acquisition, but you have no quantitative proof of finding problem-customer-solution fit. I’ve been a victim of this mistake myself.
“Inconsistent start-ups are 2.3 times more likely to spend more than one standard deviation above the average on customer acquisition” – Startup Genome Report, 2011.
Product inconsistency - Google Wave
Your focussing on adding lots of “nice to have” features, but have interviewed less than 100 potential customers or have less than 1000 online users to test and survey for problem/solution fit.
“Inconsistent startups write 3.4 times more lines of code in the discovery phase and 2.25 times more code in efficiency stage. Inconsistent startup outsource 4-5 times as much of their product development than consistent startups” – Startup Genome Report, 2011.
Business Model failure - Friendster
You’re focussing more on monetization than on growth.
“Inconsistent startups monetize 0.5 to 3 times as many of their customers early on” – Startup Genome Report, 2011.
Team inconsistency - Pets.com
You’ve placed online vacancies for positions like VP, product manager, or specialists and are introducing more than 1 level of hierarchy before having found cost-efficient scalable acquisition channels.
 
“The team size of startups that scale prematurely is 3 times bigger than the consistent startups at the same stage. However, startups that scale properly end up having a team size that is 38% bigger at the initial scale stage than prematurely scaled startups, and almost surely continue to grow. Startups that scale properly take 76% longer to scale to their team size than startups that scale prematurely” – Startup Genome Report, 2011.
Financial inconsistency - Webvan
You have raised too much money putting your team under pressure to growth, making them undisciplined focussing on wrong areas increasing the likelihood of premature scaling.
 
“Before scaling, funded inconsistent startups are on average valued twice as much as consistent startup and raise about three times as much money” – Startup Genome Report, 2011.

Write a comment if you know any examples of big start-ups that failed due to premature scaling, or whether you’ve been a victim of it yourself.
