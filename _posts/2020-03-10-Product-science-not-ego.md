As a growth marketer, I'm lucky to have the opportunity of working with product teams day-to-day. The introduction of terms like 'Growth Hacking' and 'Growth Engineering' has intrigued me for the past 3 years and I've tried to keep up with the latest developments in this area.

It seems that product teams used to work primarily on new core product features and cared solely about creating value via a rich portfolio of product attributes. Whereas letting more users experience the existing product value became somewhat secondary.

Areas like onboarding, monetization funnels, and the tech infrastructure needed for referrals or communication channels were forgotten. This is changing but still raises the question of when the product team's focus should shift from adding more core functionality towards moving the needle on growth metrics.

In this essay, I want to touch upon a few frameworks that I've come across and that can help steer these product decisions.

<h2>Three attributes to get the job done</h2>
The first framework I've based on the jobs-to-be-done concept. This traditional framework forces you to look at a product from the perspective of the user. The key question the theory asks is "What job your product is hired to do?".
It forces you to think in the first principles of product design and stay completely neutral of any solutions. Henry Ford didn't think about the "job" as a "faster horse" but as "getting from Point A to Point B as quickly as possible." Your product is hired to fulfil a job which can be defined in a job statement.

<center><i>Job Statement = Action + object + context</i></center>

The solution to the job statement comes with certain expectations. These can relate to cost, potential errors, quality, dependability, availability, ease of use, maintainability, and so fort. It's important to research the importance of each desired outcome as they will shape the product's capabilities. You can begin this research by listing clearly defined outcome statements and then identifying how satisfied users are with their current product or service.

<center><i>Outcome Statement = Improvement + measure + object of control</i></center>

By doing so, you'll quickly end up with a long list of product attributes. But it turns out there's a hidden paradox here. Products with the most features trying to do everything are rarely the ones winning. On the contrary, products like Gmail, Slack and the iPod have won their markets by initially focusing on only three core product features.<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Gmail:</b> search, easy-to-use-interface, 1GB of free storage</li>
<li><b>Slack:</b> search, synchronization, simple file-sharing</li>
<li><b>iPod:</b> pocket-size, hours of music storage, easy synchronization with Mac</li>
</ul>

Limiting your job-to-be-done to three core attributes has extremely valuable benefits:<br>
<ol>
<li>You are forcing yourself to find the true essence and value of the product;</li>
<li>Instead of ticking the box on a range of feature, you can now do these three capabilities very, very well and not worry about anything else;</li>
<li>You'll beat the market by being the best at the three things your users care about the most.</li>
</ol>

Once you've built the core product your team can shift towards the earlier mentioned 'forgotten product areas'. And as it's much cheaper to keep a customer than acquire a new customer, the north star metric of this shift should be linked to retention.

To retain customers you'll have to get more new users through the onboarding phase into forming product habits and eventually becoming power users who've mastered your product.

The clearest theory on this topic that I've come across is Csikszentmihalyi's theory of flow. Flow is the state of concentration and engagement that can be achieved when completing a task that challenges one's skills.

For new products, this means that you should not overwhelm your users with too many options, features and UI complexities. New users' product understanding will be minimal and you should thus limit the cognitive load and click-activity required to get to the next onboarding stage.

Limiting your product to three core features will make this easier to start with. But even in that case, you might want to give new users a different product experience than power users.

Applying the theory of flow should help more users reach the so-called Aha-moment. This is the magic moment from which a casual user exploring your product turns into a hardcore, loyal user that returns frequently.

<img alt="Graph showcasing the product onboarding steps for a user to reach the magic moment or aha moment by Ruben Portz" src="/images/Magic-moment.png" width="100%">


The general hypothesis of the magic moment is that there is a difference in behaviour during the early stages of the product that makes 'power' users keep using the product, and 'casual' users churn.

<h2>Examples of magic moments</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Facebook:</b> connect with 7 friends in first 10 days</li>
  <li><b>Dropbox:</b> save 1 file in folder on 1 device</li>
  <li><b>Twitter:</b> follow 30 users</li>
  <li><b>Slack:</b> 2000 messages sent within a team</li>
  <li><b>LinkedIn:</b> X connections in Y days</li>
</ul>

To find your magic moment you'll have to compare cohorts of 'power' users with other users on several metrics in order to identify an inflexion point on one of your usage metrics. Five steps that can help you do perform this analysis are:
<ol>
<li>Define when a 'power' user becomes a power user;</li>
<li>Define your cohort of 'power' users;</li>
<li>Define points in time since sign-up on which we compare 'power' and other users;</li>
<li>Define the metrics on which we will compare 'power' and other users - e.g. demographics, usage metrics, behavioural metrics;</li>
<li>Compare your 'power' and other users one metric at a time on the defined points in time.</li>
</ol>

Facebook could for instance:
<ol>
<li>Define cohorts of users by day of sign-up;</li>
<li>Define 'power' users as users who were still active after 90 days;</li>
<li>Define their comparison points in time as Day 1, Day 2, Day 5, Day 7, Day 10, Day 14, Day 28, Day 50, and Day 90;</li>
<li>Define one of the comparison metrics as 'Friends connected';</li>
<li>Plot two graphs comparing the number of friends connected on days since sign-up from 'power' users and other users;</li>
<li>Notice that 'power' users connected with 7 friends in the first 10 days whereas other users seem to never reach 7 friends or take much longer than 10 days.</li>
</ol>
  
Once you've quantified the magic moment for your product, you would want to steer your new user onboarding towards reaching that moment. This means both reducing the time duration and activity (e.g. clicks, page views, etc.) required to reach it.

<b>Tying it all together</b><br>
I want to conclude by emphasizing that there's no "I" in product. The area of product management is well researched with tonnes of frameworks and case studies to tap into. Proper user research and product planning can almost fully replace intuition and ego-driven product decisions. The above mentioned 'Jobs to be done' and 'Flow' frameworks are just the tip of the iceberg. The disciplines of design thinking, user experience, and product management have significantly evolved and their frameworks should be applied to help you get your users hooked.

In this series of essays I've now touched upon the relationship between a product and its users, but similarly, there is a relation between the revenue model and distribution channel which I will cover next.
