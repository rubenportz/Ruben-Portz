For many, startup pricing is guesswork. Without a framework that minimizes biases, I've seen founders either copy competitors or simply estimate a price. In some cases, it even gets formed into a holy grail to never be touched or discussed again.

The dark art of startup pricing should be avoided looking at the influence it has on both your product, user and distribution channel. A systematic approach to pricing can not only increase the LTV and thus sustain a higher CAC widening your market reach. It can also guide decisions on how to structure your product architecture.

During my Master's degree, I wrote my final thesis on innovative pricing models applied to the airline industry. A key framework within the academic literature on pricing is the SBIFT model named after its dimensions.

The idea is that a pricing model can be designed along five dimensions:
<ul><li><b>Scope:</b> refers to product packaging based on its features;</li>
<li><b>Base:</b> sets the price based on acquisition cost, competitors, or the value of the product;</li>
<li><b>Influence:</b> allows the user to have control over the price;</li>
<li><b>Formula:</b> refers to product packaging based on its usage;</li>
<li><b>Temporal rights:</b> deals with the duration of product usage.</li></ul>

The researchers Laatikainen, Ojala, and Mazhelis took this model further when applying it to cloud-based software services.

They've implemented a few changes to the initial model. Scope has been redefined into bundling as it's more commonly used in the SaaS domain. Formula gets a fourth option with 'performance-based' pricing. Temporal rights no longer contains 'leasing' and 'rent' simplifying the dimension. And two new dimensions were introduced.

The degree of discrimination is added as the sixth pricing dynamic and described by the authors as:

<i>"Price discrimination is used when the same product/service is offered for different buyers for a different price. This strategy is extremely important for providers of digital goods since the low marginal costs allow them to sell the offering also for customers with low willingness to pay."</i>

The dynamic pricing strategy dimension is introduced encompassing the importance of market dynamics when setting your price. According to Madhavan Ramanujam, who is a pricing expert and partner at Simon-Kucher partners, there are three clear strategies you can pick from.
<ul><li><b>Maximization or Revenue Growth</b> is ideal when there are no clear differences in customer segments' willingness to pay, and when the optimal short term and long term prices are equal.</li>
<li><b>Penetration or Market Share Capture</b> is the land-grab strategy in which you price the product at a low price to win dominant market share.</li>
<li><b>Skimming or Profit Maximization</b> is the opposite in which you start off with a high price and systematically broaden the product offering to address more of the customer base at lower prices. A great example is Apple setting a high price for new products, but selling older versions at reduced prices.</li></ul>

A consistent pricing strategy helps align sales, marketing, product and engineering teams. Pricing should thus be determined explicitly and not involve guesswork. The model is a great framework for shaping your ideal pricing model by selecting an option on each dimension.

A final point I want to make is the influence pricing can have on a product. Scope for instance directly relates to the modularity of the product. Product customizability affects the Influence dimensions. Team-User structures touch both on the Temporal Rights as the Influence dimension.

It is thus vital to make product decisions with the overall pricing strategy and model in mind. With a cheaper product infrastructure, you can charge lower prices and pursue a penetration strategy that would otherwise not have been possible. Likewise, planning for product functionality that allows bundling, customizability and multi-tenancy directly introduces more flexibility to your pricing.

<b>Conclusion</b><br>Pricing should not be guesswork solely done by founders or marketers. The above framework and dimensions can help you make decisions on pricing and understand the behaviour and tactics of competitors. It also touches on the relationship between product, user and channel. Changing one influences the other. Understanding this alone should be priceless.
