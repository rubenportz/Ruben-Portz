<h2>Consumer products are hard</h2>
Over the last four years I’ve worked on three products launching them in a total of over fifteen different countries.

No matter whether the product already had millions of registers or raised seven-figures in VC investment, it very much felt, and still feels like starting from scratch again and again.

When offering a product in a new market, it feels like you only encounter potential users who mostly don’t have time, are disinterested, and simply want to ignore you and your product altogether.

The purpose of this article isn’t to excuse for #startuplife being so hard, but rather to showcase the harsh reality of it. This is important as you or your team might get demotivated. Moreover, realizing this upfront might be a remedy and allows you to plan and prioritize better.

<h2>How bad are consumer metrics really?</h2>
Andrew Chen, General Partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, pointed out a few examples in his article on ‘Why consumer product metrics are all terrible’ and what to expect in your early days.

These metrics differ per business model and product, but he mentions to reckon with approximately the following:

<ul>
<li>“Signup rates as low as 1% (besides on homepages)”</li>
<li>“Over 95% of your users are inactive on any given day”</li>
<li>“50% of your users are forever alone”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Don’t take poor metrics as an excuse</h2>
Although product ratios might seem terrible in the first days, weeks, months or even years (depending on your runway), there are plenty of big businesses that made it despite poor percentages. Look for instance at the number of Instagrammers who never followed anyone or post less than once a month (TechCrunch, March 2011).

However, this does arise the question of what you should do? Especially if you are into product or growth and hold (partial) responsibility for these metrics.

My thinking, as of now, is to take a step back from the quantitative approach. Don’t look at each little metric every time our live dashboards refresh. That comes in handy once your past that first stage.

But instead, focus on qualitative metrics and building the top of the funnel. Two metrics in specific.

<h2>Product understanding and user intent</h2>
There are a few reasons why I like these two metrics as they:

<ol>
<li>Segment the entire user base</li>
<li>Influence your product as it matures</li>
<li>Force you to keep doing user research</li>
<li>Act as a Northstar for marketing campaigns</li>
</ol>

<h2>Phase 1 - Build trust, authority and brand recognition</h2>
When launching your product, it’s likely that nobody has ever heard of you, your brand or your product and thus there’s very limited trust. The most important part during this phase is to work on building that authority and brand recognition.

A key way to do this is offering instant value... ideally for free. If you have big budgets you could also do heavy (re)marketing campaigns and speed things up. But let’s assume we don’t have our pockets filled.

Examples of what you could do if you’re selling a SaaS product to me is to offer a free audit, high-quality templates, training material, daily tactics or anything else that me or my team can use and benefit from instantly with no learning curve and no cost.

This might seem like a long approach, but it’s you’re only shot at standing out from the crowd at a very low cost.

<center><i>“Offer a product with high value and a low learning curve, so that the audience has a high intent to start using it”</i></center>

To do this successfully you need to understand all the little needs of your future user. The tricky part is that these might be slightly different in each country and culture. So it's important you’re either a user yourself or need to do significant market research in order to be able to provide quality content and get on the radar. As you cannot live in each nation, you'll have to do research.

If you’re actually able to take a step back and do the research, then you’re much more likely to find the right need and messaging for that market. In addition, you can start doing this way before your expansion or even before your sellable product is ready. Try do document your entire journey from idea, research to launch instead of going into “stealth” mode and praying to the start-up gods.

I don’t think product understanding and intent are necessarily quantifiable, especially not at first when you’ve got no product or no users. So it might be hard to see progress. If you do want to measure velocity then you can keep track on relatable metrics such as:
<ul>
<li># users of your free content</li>
<li># of followers and members of your personal social accounts</li>
<li># interviews with potential users</li>
<li>Sentiment and engagement around your free products</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phase 2 - Adapt your product based on the intent & understanding</h2>
If you manage to start offering a lot of value upfront, then at a certain point you start attracting organic visitors to your product and you’ll start getting a hefty user base.

<center><i>“The main benefit of building awareness is the creation of relationships with individuals at scale. This is something that no competitor can steal away and even if your product fails you will have tonnes of relationships to build a new product for.”</i></center>

This user group will keep growing as you’re reaching more and more people and as a result will start forming segments.

Visitors will at first be largely skeptics or first-timers. They don’t know you and have low intent to register, but over time more and more power users arise and you would need to adapt with them.

From creating a lot of awareness and offering free content, you’re now at a stage of funnel and product optimization. You start digging into why users aren’t getting fully on-boarded, why some features are not used and others more than expected, and how people actually use the product in their day-to-day life.

This is the domain of growth engineering. A blend of product, marketing, design and UX. But before you get to that point your priority should be on building trust and brand awareness. Don't forget to lay that foundation as it will at as a catalyst for growth. That’s your Northstar during the first stage of your company and a great way to lay this foundation is by offering free value in local communities while expecting nothing in return - no sale, no sign-up, nothing - just be appreciative for anyone's attention.
