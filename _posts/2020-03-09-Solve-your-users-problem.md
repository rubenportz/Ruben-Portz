In this essay I aim to summarize 3 lessons on product-user fit after spending several years in the startup scene. These lessons are both helpful for starting from scratch and for expanding an existing product into new markets.

<h2><b>Lesson #1:</b> You can’t build a great product without solving a real problem.</h2> 

Although this seems common sense nowadays, I’ve noticed that most startup advice is still focused on building products and not on identifying real problems. This is reflected by the fact that most startup people are either actively building products or coming up with tactics to make more money with it. You hardly hear someone saying that they spend the day talking to strangers and listening to their problems.

User feedback and research aren’t placed on an equal pedestal as engineering. Yet, I don’t think that success in the tech scene has much to do with shipping features. It has everything to do with moving user metrics.

Daily releases are great, but only if you know what product to build. If you’re simply using intuition then it seems more rational to release on a slower cycle and spend more time on making sure that the releases are actual improvements.

I feel that the best advice is therefore around the user and creating the best possible solution for their problem. This might be a product, but could also be a process improvement or a shift in mindset in many cases as well. 

<h2><b>Lesson #2:</b> Don't be selfish and build the product <i>you</i> want, but build the products <i>your users</i> want.</h2>

People pay companies to solve their problems. Thinking in solutions causes you to address their issues. But you can’t solve every problem and need to pick your battle wisely.

Looking back after seeing many companies from up close in a startup accelerator and working from coworking spaces, I can now see that the teams who progressed the quickest had an edge. The company founders had an advantage over other people to solve the problem that they were working on. 

An edge is either technical or based on deep industry expertise. In the first case the founders have world-class skills in a specific technology and are able to use that to solve pressing issues. A high portion of these people will have a technical PhD or worked for multiple years on the cutting-edge of the technology. 

In the latter case the founders have industry know-how of a specific problem and can already see a clear route-to-market. This is generally formed by working for multiple years in a specific industry and having dealt with the problem from multiple angles.

Once you’ve developed your edge - which will take a long time - and identified a problem area it’s time to zoom in on the user-problem-solution fit. 

Keep in mind that it’s important to focus on a product that you know users will love, not one you think users will want. Before quitting your job and starting to build a first version it makes a lot of sense to spend as much time as possible on knowing your users and their problem. 

You should really want to take away as many uncertainties as possible otherwise you will fail quickly. Trust me, I know how that goes. 


A simple, and most likely the best way to get on the right track is by talking to a lot of users. I’ve found that the following questions are a really good guidance to structure user research:
<ol>
<li>What is the job your user needs to get done?</li>
<li>Why are they motivated to do a better job at that?</li>
<li>What are the criteria for a successful outcome of the job completion?</li>
<li>How satisfied are they with the current solution?</li>
</ol>
There are also many ways you can perform user research:

The next step would be to prioritise the identified problems based on their frequency and intensity. Separating the not-so-important occasional headaches from a pressing migraine that needs to be solved right now.

Your first iteration of user research will probably turn into a lot of ideas and hypotheses that now need to get validated. This can take months but is your opportunity to build a foundation for continuous user feedback.

<h2><b>Lesson #3:</b> Build a user feedback engine for your team</h2>

When you just start off with an idea and problem you can meet with users everyday. If you do this right you will have a community to tap into forever. 

A place to show your wireframes, test high-fidelity designs and let hard-coded functionality get scrutinized. This will save you so much time down the line by being able to quickly receive input and reduce uncertainties. 

Your team will also love you for this as they will be able to get user data on specific issues themselves very easily. That way the team can rationally decide what they should build for the user themselves, and not just create whatever you or the founders want. This might sound weird if you’re a bit selfish, but it will be the best empowerment and responsibility a team can get. As a result they will be more motivated resulting in faster and higher quality work.

Once you’ve implemented your user feedback engine and have iterated through several problems it’s time to translate your research findings into core product functionality.
