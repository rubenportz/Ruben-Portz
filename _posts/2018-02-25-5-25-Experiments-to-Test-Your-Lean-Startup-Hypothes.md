It's rare that you interview someone and although it's not a great fit right now, he or she is genuinely interested in knowing how to develop further.

In that situation I think it's only fair to take time and give a sense of direction. I understand that big corporates avoid this at all cost for legal reasons, but that's probably a guarantee someone will not get back to them once they're actually ready for it.

##Technical Marketing + Community Building
I've put below a menu of resources for developing yourself further as a technical marketer. I've recommended these to my team, people I didn't hire, or anyone who's willing to listing to me.

This recommendation is focussed on smaller growth teams (<10 people). Especially if you need to be multi-facetted and have a growth mindset. No matter what industry you're in, these resources will be helpful at early-stage start-ups.

I recommend developing deep expertise in the next five topics and from there on building a broader knowledge base in a variety of other areas among community building should be top of the list.

1. Google Analytics | Blog, Tutorial, Resources & another Tutorial with special focus on all admin settings such as views, goals, funnels, custom dimensions & metrics, eCommerce, filters as well as the new web+app and attribution functionality.
2. Tag Manager | Blog and Tutorials to know every capability especially custom variables, triggers and events.
3. Data Studio | Tutorials to built data visualisations. You can use GA's sample data sets to play around.
4. SQL Queries & Google BigQuery |  Udemy course and Tutorials
5. Technical SEO and Search Console | Blog, Tutorials, Search Console

In my opinion, the associated sources are a great start to build a solid foundation in these 5 areas. I really recommend going through as many tutorials and blog posts as possible as well as find additional practice material and real-life examples if you're interested in developing in the area of growth marketing. The best people in our team really have made it routine to keep developing themselves on a daily basis and to never stop learning via books, blogs, online courses and youtube videos.

From there on I recommend getting familiar with:
- Growth tools and resources
- Growth strategy including sales funnels, growth loops, CAC, LTV, experimentation (AAARRR) and business models
- Advanced GSheet, formulas, scripts and macros
- Automations using Chrome extensions, Zapier and PhantomBuster
- Onboarding using custom landing pages and email flows
- Creating creatives for Ad platforms, YouTube, SlideDecks, Landingpages using tools like Canva
- Familiarity with organic and paid social media platforms

Additional websites and persons that I think are very interesting to follow are: Andrew Chen, Brian Balfour, Matthew Barby, Seth Godin, Gary Vaynerchuck, Josh Fechter, Sean Ellis / Growthhackers.com as well as to have a look at my own Udemy course.
