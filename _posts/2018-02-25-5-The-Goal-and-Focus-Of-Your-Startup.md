The biggest thing for any business idea, especially digital products, is to just do it. Just get started. Which should be the easy part. But that's obviously not enough. Having absorbed the Berlin and London start-up world, there are a few take-aways I want to share to anyone pursuing their business ideas. 

I'm sure they will apply to you. I've been reading them everytime me or a friend approaches me to start working on a new product ideas. It has helped me a lot in the early days of new product ideas to do the right things. 



Focus: smallest things to build and put in front of customers to test viability of sales

Goal: maximize the rate of learning, by minimizing the time to try ideas

Priority: speed and excitement

Motto: Doing is the best type of thinking

Progress: Get 10% better each week on some metric to feel progress (ideally revenue)
