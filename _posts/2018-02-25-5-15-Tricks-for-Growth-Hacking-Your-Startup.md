Google	Do a 150$ google ad campaign testing a bunce of stuff to figure out what resonate and learn
Facebook, Twitter, Google pre-target	Upload your email address you collected from the website, so warm them up with 4 or 5 brand messages ($400), so that they at least so your brand and logo before you're asking for the big move
Channel	Use the bullseye framework
Social media	Download followers from competitor pages and load them into your online ad targeting campaign
Ads on competitor	Imagine your biggest competitor is having some kind of crisis. For hosting companies, it would be massive server downtime. For automobile makers, it would be major recalls. For a restaurant, it would be an outbreak of food poisoning. This is all stuff you can learn about if you are following your competitors closely via their fan pages as previously mentioned.
RSS feed competitor	Use google reader or facebook RSS feed to monitor your competitors
Hashtags feed on website	Use hashtags like #GreenAviation #CharterThursday and  put the feed on the website page
Referral discount	Invite a friend and get 10% of his charter price in cash   (need a link, or send us an email/online sign-up form with the person details, and if he then books you'll get the discount)
Feedback and share post	Every time Groove wrote a new blog post, they sent a personalized outreach email asking key influencers for feedback. When Groove published a blog post, theyâ€™d shoot another email asking people to share it. 
Google competitor + sucks	Find free feedback on competitors
Online feedback	Find free feedback and complaints on amazon, app store, youtube
Journalist	Reach out to journalists that have written about competitor before you go live and need them
Email marketing	Don't do the same as your competitors. How do you feel about their email? Do you read their stupid info emails? What does it bring to you, any value? Why don't you bring them value, that's not necesarily related to your product/service. Perhaps recommend a good book.

Don't show ads again	If someone clicked on your ad and downloaded your eBook, why would you spend additional advertising dollars showing them the ad again?!

Shockingly, many Facebook advertisers let this happen. 

What you need to do to prevent this is to create a custom audience comprised of all your leads that have already converted.

Then, when create or edit your ad set, you need to exclude that custom audience from your larger target audience.
Separate add placement	By default, Facebook will try to put your ads in the news feed, the right column, on Instagram and on the Audience Network.

But not all placements are equal! They can have massively different performance levels and thus costs per click!

To see how your ads perform across placements, go to your ads report, and use the breakdown menu to organize your data by placement.
