When asking what it takes to create a profitable company with $10M+ in annual revenue, the startup community tends to give one of three answers: 

1. Build great product<br>
2. Find product-market fit<br>
3. Growth hacking<br>

In the past 4 years I’ve had the chance to work with companies on a journey towards that horizon. During this time I’ve obsessively followed all the silver-bullet growth tactics, probably have had hundreds of in-depth conversations about product-market fit, and learned how to code in order to understand the benefits of technical marketing.

I’m interested in the $10M+ question, but don’t have a blueprint answer just yet. Nonetheless, I did learn a few lessons along the way and identified 12 key frameworks that can help your thinking which I aim to illustrate in this series of essays.

There are three key points I want to narrow down to and which are illustrated in the diagram below:

<ol>
<li><b>Each startup should have a laser focus on finding fit between their User, Product, Channel and Pricing based on the traditional business model canvas.</b></li>
<li><b>The four fits will change but can be found and sustained via repeatable, scalable and profitable processes.</b></li>
<li><b>The structure, discipline and expertise of your team will determine whether you’re able to create and execute the processes and consequently sustain the right fits fast enough.</b></li>
</ol>

I’ve decided to start the series covering the <i>User</i> as I think it’s more important to focus on the people who buy the product than the product itself.

So, let’s get started!

<b>Introduction</b><br>
Phase 1: Solve your user’s problem (coming soon)<br>
Phase 2: Product science not ego (coming soon)<br>
Phase 3: The power law of distribution (coming soon)<br>
Phase 4: A framework for startup pricing (coming soon)<br>
