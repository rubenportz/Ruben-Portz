Yesterday I came across an examplary marketing plan for early-stage founders. I mean, if you never pulled together a marketing plan and are starting out your first business, then definitely have a look at how simple and fast you can pull something together. 

It was the original plan that Noah Kagan of AppSumo.com (Daily deals for web geeks) proposed to Aaron Patzer when he started working Mint.com. Mint is a free personal finance tool and was bought by Intuit for $170 million less than two years after it started.

I copied it in below for your inspiration.

Marketing Game Plan for MyMint 

Goal 
a) 80,000 users within 6 months of public launch 
b) Write up in a major publication (WSJ, Wired, Etc...) 

Objectives of Launch 
a) Test out MyMint service 
b) Tell a friend whether they login or not 
c) Provide a way for them to enjoy experience without giving sensitive information 
d) Find cheerleaders in the beta process to help us promote the service 

Target Users (in priority order) - which customer demographics are most important / most relevant? 
- Young Professionals, don't want to waste time and want easy way to see finances. My feeling is that there are a lot of techies looking for deals, ways to save money and scour the web for it. We can easily get them as early adopters and then transition later to the mainstream. 
- People in debt, wants to find new ways to save more money and get out of debt. 3) New Families, mothers like knowing they can save for there goals

i) On his live financial's have bubbles showcasing the features of the site. Similar to a tour of the product. 
i) Highlight 3 key things about the service, effortless tracking, automatic categorization & instant saving offers. 
or

- Show savings counter either per last hour/day or overall depending on activity and size. TBD after initial alpha launch. 
- Link to current offers available or allow someone to put in there, bank, credit card, cell phone, mortgage, etc.. and we can show related offers about there. 
- Links on bottom of the page: in the news, about, financial tips, blog, SECURITY, 
- Everyone has a cell phone. We can allow everyone to enter there cell phone plan (minutes, cost) and recommend alternatives. I want to have some way that people can interact and benefit from the site immediately. Then they can email it to friends. Great example: http://personal.fidelity.com/planning/retirement/content/myPlan/index.shtml or http://www.creditcardclients.com/sa/?s=pbz511 

Action Marketing Plans: 
Today 
- Add email collection to homepage with prompt. 
- "How do you currently manage your finances?" 
- "What kind of things would you want in a financial product?"
- "Would you like more money while doing less?" 

Alpha Launch Strategy 
- Have satisfaction survey that is numeric and must return greater than 90% reviews. This is a numeric questionnaire that we provide for all people testing the product. 
- Launch to all investors, family and selected colleagues. 
- Have metric dashboard in place (see metrics above) 
- Structure code so ability to implement a/b testing and measurement of a/b results. 
- SEM marketing and SEO piece 
- Review the site for free with my good friends at pronetadvertising.com who are seo/ sem experts ii) Make sure initial site has basics of SEO implemented, meta description, titles, url link structure 
i- Contract with specific bloggers different verticals of information to have a library of content that will be indexed for seo and provide good resources for users. 
- We need to create our elite squad that we can put into different vertical and repost their content on our site. 
- Initiate contact with celebrity endorsers. Suze Orman, Robert Kiyosake, etc... 

Beta Launch Strategy 
- Have satisfaction survey that is numeric and must return greater than 90% reviews. 
- Invite key financial bloggers, a few mom bloggers and a few gossip/female related bloggers to participate and provide feedback (listed above). 
- Decide which exclusive publication will receive first press of the product. My best guess is WSJ, I have a great connection there. 
- Provide exclusive video interview to Robert Scoble of Scobleshow, friend of mine and Dave's. That will be shown when we do our public launch. 
- Work with popsugar.com on an article for young girls (college). 
- Leak out to Tech Crunch some of the details of the project to get some buzz going. 
- Provide link for feedback and bug submissions. 
- Collect 1-2 user testimonials from people using the product to put on the site during public launch. 
- Advertise on Paulstamatiou.com 
- Notify Online Banking Report of upcoming launch and give him early review of product. Public 

Launch Strategy 
- Provide tool without referral fee for people to invite friends. This should be always visible in the bottom left corner. focus on referrals. 
- Allow people to sign up for our monthly newsletter. This will be provided to all registered users as well provide us with people who aren't ready to use the product but want monthly tips on saving and managing their money. 
- Message board. I want to provide some ways that the product is not completely individual and there is a community around personal savings. There is not one major online forum for personal finances which gives us a great opportunity. This can be an out of box solution like phpBB or vbulletin. 
- Display content of preferred partners who list us as elite partners on their site. 
- Email Emily Chang, e@emilychang.com, to get listed on her ehub new company site: emilychang.com/go/ehub 
- Spend 4 hours doing MySpace / Facebook guerilla marketing for females, groups and message boards. 
- Add article about how to easily save money on ehow.com and wikihow.com 
- Post ads (free) on craigslist in metrpolitan areas letting people know about the service. 
- Make sure to highlight the security once someone has logged in and is considering providing their financial information. We should have a very simple security policy on the bottom of the site. 
- Post on Digg + reddit. 

30 Day Post Public Launch Strategy 
- Evaluate launching referral fee at this point. We want natural organic and word of mouth growth to spur initial trials. We can turn this on at this point or later depending if the growth is greater than some target, say 30% users week over week. 
- Message people in online community forums. (List above) 
- Review traffic logs to see where referrals are coming from, what people are doing on the site and optimize site based on this feedback. 
- If we have significant statistics in terms of savings or users we should release a press release to the media. 
- Promote our savings to $1 million challenge if we think it is feasible that we can reach it by the end of the year. 
- Consider exclusive partnerships on specific things, ie. Wells Fargo for banking, T-mobile for cell phones. 

Dave's Questions + Notes: 
- what messages/benefits would be most likely to hit home with them? 
- what are the costs / efforts / resources / time required for each, and what is relative size / potential for each? 
- Check out PC World reviews 
- Consider advertising here, http://mindpetals.com/ 
- Something to compare and devise our launch metrics, https://www.wesabe.com/ page/news 
- Things to do and add to the tasklist, tour, security policy, our promise, badges from trust companies, frequently asked questions, our purple cow and viral part, and lastly something related to community (small as message board) from the beginning. Possible design and money advisors. 
- Consider doing the million dollar savings after alpha/private beta launch
