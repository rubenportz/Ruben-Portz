     A/B Testing Over $1M Worth of Displays Ads <br>
  </h3>
<p>
<b>Why:</b> Improve your product and add features that your potential users want to see, plus build relationships with potential advocates.<br><br>

<b>Implementation:</b>

Find a relevant subreddit for your product or post in the /r/startups with an overview of what your product aims to do.
Ask for feedback on the idea and any particular features that people would like to see.
Engage within the comments and compile all of the feedback into a manageable format. You could consider using Google Forms for quick multiple choice questions.
Direct anyone that seemed interested to leave their details with you for future updates on the product's progress (you could use a data capture form on a landing page or just message the Reddit user).
When it comes to launch time, get in touch with these individuals and explain the changes you made (if any) based on their feedback. Give them early access as a thank you, ideally for free when possible, and ask if they'd share it with their peers.<br><br>
<b>Useful Tools:</b> Google Forms, Survey Monkey, Reddit.</p><br><br></li>

PR in 60 seconds
</h3>
<p style="why"><b>Why:</b>
True relationships with journalists at top-notch magazines, tv-stations and online blogs are invaluable. Image you could pitch any story and get 50,000 visitors to your website the next day. PR is still important, but how do you get to the big guns when you’re just starting out.
<br><br>
<b>Implementation:</b>
<ol>
<li>Start connecting with individual writers on Twitter that write content in your industry</li>
<li>Follow them and start providing value to the online community that they form a part. Drop your $0.02 on some of their posts and try to get a conversation going.</li>
<li>Send an email asking what the best way to get in touch is when publishing a release and what their criteria are.</li>
<li>Keep your pitch to the point</li>
<li>Save big stories for the major journals, and start working your way up. First contact blogs with hardly any traffic, and go for larger publications once you’re starting to get noticed.</li>
<li>Work your network and see who has connections to the big journalists. What can you do for them to get an introduction?</li>
</ol>

How Do You Increase Your Quality Score?
</h3>
<p style="why"><b>Why:</b>
The Quality Score of your Google Ads account is an estimate determined by Google of your ad copy, keywords, and landing pages. Higher quality ads can lead to lower cost per click and higher click-through rate (CTR). It’s an indication of the health of your ads, but should not be the only focus of your account manager.
<br><br>
<b>Implementation:</b> If you treat your ads account like a garden, then you’re quality scores will go up. To maintain a garden you have to give your flowers water, weed the ground, and remove dead leafs. Your Google Ads account deserves the same daily attention. So what should you do?
<ol>
<li><b>Keyword Research</b> - Find long-tail keyword opportunities by regularly checking your Google Search Console, Google Keyword Planner and Google Ads Search Queries. Another way to find new keyword is to enable Dynamic Search Ads on all relevant web pages.</li>
<li><b>Keyword Organization</b> - Keep your campaign and adgroup structure organized. A lot of agencies like to apply the tactic of one keyword per adgroup, but this is definitely no guarantee for higher performances. Instead, keep around 10 to 30 relevant keywords together in one adgroup and have at least three ads per adgroup</li>
<li><b>Negative Keyword Lists</b></li> - Everyday go through your search queries to find new search terms that are irrelevant and add them to your negative keyword list. This is the only way to clean your account and stop paying for irrelevant search terms. 
<li><b>Split Test Ad Copy</b></li> - Each adgroup should have three or more ads with different copy that you rotate to identify the best performers. Once you have enough data, then remove the poor performing ads and write new copy based on the top performance. This cycle of testing can go on forever.
<li><b>Optimize Landing Pages</b></li> - Leading your traffic to your homepage is an absolute killer. If you do not have a separate landing page per campaign or even adgroup, then you’re missing out big time. The H1 and H2 of your landing page should be very similar to the ad, and the content or offering on the page should be relevant to your ad target audience.
